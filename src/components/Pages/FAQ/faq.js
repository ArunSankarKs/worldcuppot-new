                  <Accordion.Body>

                  <Accordion.Body>
                  Our NFTs are different because they are used in AI matches and can affect the results. Winning matches will earn the NFT owners tokens and stat upgrades.

                  <Accordion.Body>
                  Matches are primarily driven by a Verifiable Random Function and the NFT playerâ€™s stats. The engine will evolve over time to reflect a real and exciting match on the field.
